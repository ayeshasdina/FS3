## This repository is built upon the paper titled "FS3: Few-Shot and Self-Supervised Framework for Efficient Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things Networks".

To execute this code, we have already provided the "requirements.txt" file which contains all the necessary packages for installation.

## Regarding the dataset: 
The WUSTL-EHMS dataset originates from a real-time Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (EHMS) that records network flow metrics and patients' biometrics. It comprises four main components: medical sensors, gateways, networks, and control with visualization. Patient data collected by sensors is transmitted through gateways, switches, and routers to the server. However, there's a potential risk of data interception, especially through man-in-the-middle attacks involving spoofing and data injection. The dataset includes 43 features, encompassing 35 network flow features and 8 patients' biometric features. Samples are labeled as "Normal" or "Attack", with attacker MAC addresses assigned a label of 1 and the rest as 0, based on the Source MAC address feature. Similar to the WUSTL-IIoT dataset, the WUSTL-EHMS dataset lacks separate training and testing datasets. To address this, the dataset is randomly divided into training and testing datasets since it lacks a timestamp feature. The dataset is located in the "dataset" folder.
